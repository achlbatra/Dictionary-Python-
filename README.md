# VerbaVis ðŸ“–

VerbaVis is a simple and interactive dictionary application built with Streamlit. It allows users to look up the definitions of words and provides suggestions for close matches if the exact word is not found.

## Features

- **Word Lookup**: Enter a word to get its definition.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Handles words in different cases (lowercase, uppercase, title case).
- **Close Matches**: Suggests close matches if the word is not found in the dictionary.
- **Interactive UI**: Clear and user-friendly interface with a "Rerun" button to reset and restart the application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/verba-vis.git
    cd verba-vis
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Add your dictionary data**:
    - Place your `data.json` file in the project directory. Ensure it is a valid JSON file with word definitions.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Open your web browser**:
    - Go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the application.
